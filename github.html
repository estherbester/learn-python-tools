<h1>Getting started on GitHub</h1>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a github account</li>
    <li>Push/pull from github repos</li>
</ul>


<h2>Before we begin</h2>
<p>You should already know what these git commands do</p>
<ol>
    <li><tt>git status</tt></li>
    <li><tt>git add</tt></li>
    <li><tt>git commit</tt></li>
    <li><tt>git log</tt></li>
</ol>


<h2>Configure your git environment</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open up Git Bash</li>
    <li>Copy the following lines into the shell prompt, one at a time (include the quotes):</li>
    <li> <tt>git config --global user.email "youremail@cars.com"</tt></li>
    <li> <tt>git config --global user.name "your name"</tt></li>
</ol>


<h2>Join Github</h2>

<p>Sign up for an account at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong class="warning">WARNING: For our purposes, know that anything work you do on GitHub is public and viewable to everyone in the world!!*</strong></p>

<br />

<h2>Fork a repo from Github.</h2>
<p>I have prepared a repository of files where we will be doing much of our work from now on. You will copy this repository into your own GitHub account, which is called <em>forking</em></p>
<ol>
    <li> Go to my Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/enam-cars/learn-python">https://github.com/enam-cars/learn-python</a></li>
    <li> Locate the "fork" button and press it (see #1 in screencap below)</li>
    <li> You will now have a fork of the repo in your own account!!<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39730/github_fork.png" /></li>

</ol>

<h2>Clone your fork to your working environment (your computer)</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Navigate to your fork, in your repo, and copy the HTTP url (see #2 in screencap).</li>
    <li> In the Git Bash shell, navigate to your User folder and type
        <br /> <tt>git clone PASTE_THE_URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED_HERE</tt></li>
    <li> This will automatically download your fork of the GitHub repository from the cloud and save it to a new folder called "learn-python"</li>
    <li> Verify that the previous statement is true by navigating to the "learn-python" directory and see if the files in there match the ones listed in the GitHub repo<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39730/github_clone.png" /></li>
</ol>

<p>And you're done! (For now)</p>

<div style="display:none;">
<h2>Track the upstream branch (enam-cars)</h2>
<ol>
    <li> go to the home repo (enam-cars/learn-python.git), copy the url</li>
    <li> in the shell, type <pre>git remote add [enam] [your fork URL]</pre></li>
    <li> now you are "tracking" my repo, so if I make any changes in my repo, you can pull them down. We'll learn how to do that at the end of this class.</li>
</ol>

<h2>(Optional) Git credential store</h2>
If you get sick of typing in your github password every time, you can your Github credentials in Windows.
<ol>
<li>Download the Credential Store installer <a href="http://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/">here</a>
    <li>In Git Bash, type <tt>git --exec-path</tt> This will give you the path to the git executable. It's probably something like <tt>C:\Program Files\Git/libexec/git-core/git</tt></li>
    <li>In Git Bash, navigate to the folder where you saved the Credential Store installer</li>
    <li>In Git Bash, run this command: <tt>github-credential-store.exe -i [the path you just copied to clipboard]</tt></li>
    <li>Say "Yes" when the popup asks if you want to store your credentials. </li>
    <li>If you then get an error message, let Esther or Andrew know. Otherwise, you should not see anything else happen.</li>
    <li>The next time you push something to Github, you will have to enter your username/password one last time, but after that you will no longer be prompted</li>
</ol>


<h2>Do some stuff!</h2>

<h2>Push</h2>
<p>Let's say you made some changes in your repo: you edited a file, deleted a file, or added a new file. You need to tell git to track these changes in version control</p>
<ol>
    <li><tt>git add</tt> will add the file to your git tracker</li>
    <li><tt>git commit</tt> will stage your changes and allow you to add comments to describe the changes you made</li>
    <li><tt>git push</tt> will copy your changes from your local file into Github. </li>

</ol>

<h2>(Advanced) Generating SSH Key for Github</h2>

<p>If you'd prefer to use SSH rather than the password store over HTTPS, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">Github's own guide</a></p>
